# Web API Code Quiz

## Description

This week we built a timed coding quize with mutliple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser which allows user to take part in answering 5 questions within a time frame. For each incorrect answer, the time will be subtracted from the clock. When all the questions are answered or when the timer reaches 0, then the quiz will end allowing the user to input their initials and view their final quiz score.

## Usage

To get familiar with completing coding assessment as well as to familiarize with user with week 4 Module.
